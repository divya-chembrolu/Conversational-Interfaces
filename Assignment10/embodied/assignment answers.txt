1. Conversational embodied character

We are moving towards studying non-verbal behaviors. The example code for the converstional embodied character that we will be working with is located at:

https://github.com/maxipesfix/coversational_interfaces_spring_2017/tree/master/embodied

(Note the new location.)

Clone the repository or copy the contents of the "embodied" directory to your computer. Study the code:
- verbal.js you contains the familar code that performs speech recognition and finite state machine-based dialogue.
- nonverbal.js contains the code that animates the character.

You can find more about the way the animated character is built by reading its creator's tutorial:
http://www.williammalone.com/articles/create-html5-canvas-javascript-game-character/1/

To help you understand the code:

1.1 Replace the graphics with your own. Make your own animated character and give it a name.
A - Divya is working on this

1.2 Find where in verbal.js the following behaviors are called:
- jump - Line number 33 in verbal.js
- breath rate increase/decrease - line number 16 and line number 32 in verbal.js
- blink rate increase/decrease - line number 15 in verbal.js

Hint: Look for the comments saying "Nonverbal..."

Find in nonverbal.js the implementation of:
- jump - line number 207 in nonverbal.js
- breath rate increase/decrease - line number 179 in nonverbal.js
- blink rate increase/decrease - line number 192 in nonverbal.js
- eye color setting - line number 160 in nonverbal.js

1.3 Edit the behaviors in verbal.js and nonverbal.js so that the eyes of the character are RED when the character is listening.

1.4. Add your latest task or non-task oriented chatbot code from the previous homework into verbal.js. Make sure it works with the animated character.

1.4 Submit your work to your on directory on github, called hw6.


2. Team assignment: Prepare a demo of your project work so far to be presented next Monday. The demo should ideally include a prototype that works: it can be a very small peice of your final product, but it should do something.
